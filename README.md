# RustBindingsTutorial

## Objectives

After this tutorial, you should be able to:
- understand how rust bindings are generated using `bindgen`
- create a Rust binding for a C library, and use it in Rust program.

## Tutorial Instructions

1. Read through the [bindgen documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/introduction.html) section 1-3. This should give you a good idea on how to use bindgen.
2. Locate `./tutorial/build.rs`.
3. Implement the `TODO` section in `build.rs`.
4. After completing the `TODO` section, you should see `"Generating first rust bindings!"` in terminal output when you run `cargo build`
